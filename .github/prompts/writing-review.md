## Documentation Review Focus

Review this documentation change for:

### Technical Accuracy
- Code examples must compile and run correctly
- API references must match current SDK/CLI versions
- Command syntax must be accurate
- Import paths and package names must be valid

### Clarity & Structure
- Clear explanations with logical flow
- Appropriate detail level for the audience
- No ambiguous or confusing instructions
- Proper use of headings and organization

### Terminology Consistency
- Use official Hyperlane terms: ISM, Warp Route, Mailbox, Hook
- Don't mix terms or use unofficial names
- Consistent capitalization and formatting

### Code Examples
- Snippets should work when copy-pasted
- Include necessary imports and context
- Use current SDK patterns, not deprecated APIs

### Links & References
- Internal links work (relative paths without .mdx)
- External links are appropriate and accessible
- Cross-references to related docs are helpful
