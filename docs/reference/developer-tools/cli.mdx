## Overview[​](#overview "Direct link to Overview")

The Hyperlane CLI is the official command-line tool for deploying Hyperlane contracts to new chains. It also includes utilities for interacting with deployed contracts and registries.

The published version is available [on NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@hyperlane-xyz/cli). The source is available [on GitHub in the monorepo](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/tree/main/typescript/cli).

## Setup[​](#setup "Direct link to Setup")

<Check>[Node 18](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or newer is required</Check>

To install the CLI globally, use the `npm install -g` command. This will the `hyperlane` command available anywhere in your terminal.

```
# Install with NPM
npm install -g @hyperlane-xyz/cli

# Or uninstall old versions
npm uninstall -g @hyperlane-xyz/cli
```

Alternatively, for running individual commands, you can use `npx` or `dlx`:

```
# Run via NPM's npx command
npx @hyperlane-xyz/cli

# Or via Yarn's dlx command
yarn dlx @hyperlane-xyz/cli
```

## Usage[​](#usage "Direct link to Usage")

To view a list of the available commands and their arguments, run `hyperlane --help`.

A few common command options include:

- `--version`: Display your current installed version of the CLI
- `--registry`: Set the registry URI to use for chain metadata and contract addresses
- `--overrides`: Set an additional path for overrides to the canonical registry data
- `log`: Set the log format for the CLI (defaults to pretty)
- `verbosity`: Set the log level for the CLI (defaults to info)
- `key`: Set the key to use for signing transactions (defaults to the HYP_KEY env var)

## Registries[​](#registries "Direct link to Registries")

By default, the CLI will pull chain metadata and contract addresses from the [canonical Hyperlane Registry](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-registry) but will write new configs and deployments to your local filesystem. For more information see the [Registries page](/docs/reference/registries).

## Warp Route ID

Many CLI commands accept a `--warp-route-id` flag to specify which warp route to use.

**Aliases:** `-w`, `--id`

**Accepts:**
- `SYMBOL/label` - exact route ID (e.g., `ETH/ethereum-arbitrum`)
- `SYMBOL` - auto-resolves if unique, prompts if multiple (errors in CI)

**Resolution logic:**
1. If input contains `/` → exact match
2. If SYMBOL only → find all routes with that symbol
   - Single match → use it
   - Multiple matches + interactive → prompt selection
   - Multiple matches + CI → error with list of options
3. Commands with `--origin`/`--destination` (e.g., `warp send`) use those to filter matches
4. Deprecated route IDs auto-resolve with warning

**Examples:**
```bash
# Full route ID
hyperlane warp check -w ETH/viction

# Symbol only - auto-selects if unique
hyperlane warp apply --id USDC

# Symbol + chain filter (warp send)
hyperlane warp send -w ETH --origin ethereum --destination arbitrum

# Deprecated ID - works but warns
hyperlane warp check -w ETH/viction-ethereum
# ⚠️  "ETH/viction-ethereum" is deprecated, resolving to "ETH/viction"
```
