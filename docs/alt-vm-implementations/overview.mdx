title: "Alt-VM Implementations"
---

While our public documentation currently focuses on EVM compatibility, we offer varying levels of support for additional ecosystems. These ecosystems may not have full feature parity or complete tooling integration (such as TypeScript CLI support) at this time. We're actively working to expand our documentation and tooling across these platforms.

<Note>
  If you're excited about building on top of these or bringing Hyperlane to
  other new ecosystems, reach out on [our
  Discord](https://discord.gg/hyperlane)!
</Note>

## Cosmos

### CosmosSDK

The Hyperlane Cosmos SDK module, enables direct integration with Cosmos SDK-based blockchains. See [Hyperlane - Cosmos SDK Module](/docs/alt-vm-implementations/cosmos-sdk).

### CosmWasm[​](#cosmwasm "Direct link to CosmWasm")

See the CosmWasm implementation of Hyperlane [here,](https://github.com/many-things/cw-hyperlane) implemented and maintained by the [Mitosis team](https://mitosis.org/).

Follow [this guide](https://github.com/many-things/cw-hyperlane/blob/main/DEPLOYMENT.md) on how to deploy to a Cosmos appchain here. We're live on Celestia, Stride and Neutron as of July 2024.

## Sealevel

Hyperlane v3 for Solana Virtual Machine is live now on Solana and Eclipse, with more Solana rollups coming soon.

You can find the Sealevel contract [implementation here](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/rust/sealevel/programs).

<Info>
  **Does Hyperlane use Anchor for Solana programs?**

- No, Hyperlane’s core Solana programs do not use Anchor.

**Can I use Anchor for building on Hyperlane’s Solana integration?**

- Yes. Although Hyperlane itself doesn’t use Anchor, it’s possible to build with it. For example: [Everclear’s Solana spoke](https://github.com/everclearorg/monorepo/tree/dev/packages/contracts/solana-spoke/programs/everclear_spoke/src) - uses Anchor with Hyperlane’s SVM mailbox.

**What testing frameworks can I use for Solana programs?**

- Hyperlane uses the `solana-program-test` crate for unit and integration testing. This is a native Rust tool. If you're using Anchor, you might find Anchor's built-in testing utilities or general Rust test frameworks helpful.

## Cairo

The Hyperlane protocol has been implemented in Cairo for Starkware by the [Pragma team](https://www.pragma.build/).

You can find the in progress [implementation here](https://github.com/astraly-labs/hyperlane_starknet).

## Move

Hyperlane has been implemented in MoveVM by [Movement Labs](https://movementlabs.xyz/).

You can find the in progress [implementation here](https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/hyperlane-monorepo). These Move contracts are live on Movement's M1 testnet.

## Sway

Find our in progress [Sway implementation here](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/fuel-contracts).
