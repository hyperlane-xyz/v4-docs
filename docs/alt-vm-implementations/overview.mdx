title: "Alt-VM Implementations"
---

While Hyperlane documentation was historically EVM-first, we now support additional ecosystems with varying levels of feature and tooling parity. Some workflows still differ by protocol (for example, certain CLI commands or testing flows), and we're continuing to close those gaps across platforms.

<Note>
  If you're excited about building on top of these or bringing Hyperlane to
  other new ecosystems, reach out on [GitHub
  Discussions](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/discussions)!
</Note>

## Cosmos

### CosmosSDK

The Hyperlane Cosmos SDK module enables direct integration with Cosmos SDK-based blockchains. The Hyperlane CLI supports deploying core infrastructure and Warp Routes on `cosmosnative` chains. See [Cosmos SDK Module](/docs/alt-vm-implementations/cosmos-sdk) for architecture details, or get started with the [Deploy to a Cosmos Chain](/docs/guides/chains/deploy-hyperlane-cosmos) guide.

### CosmWasm[​](#cosmwasm "Direct link to CosmWasm")

See the CosmWasm implementation of Hyperlane [here,](https://github.com/many-things/cw-hyperlane) implemented and maintained by the [Mitosis team](https://mitosis.org/).

Follow [this guide](https://github.com/many-things/cw-hyperlane/blob/main/DEPLOYMENT.md) on how to deploy to a Cosmos appchain here. We're live on Celestia, Stride and Neutron as of July 2024.

## Sealevel

Hyperlane v3 for Solana Virtual Machine is live now on Solana and Eclipse, with more Solana rollups coming soon.

You can find the Sealevel contract [implementation here](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/blob/main/rust/sealevel/programs).

<Info>
  **Does Hyperlane use Anchor for Solana programs?**

- No, Hyperlane’s core Solana programs do not use Anchor.

**Can I use Anchor for building on Hyperlane’s Solana integration?**

- Yes. Although Hyperlane itself doesn’t use Anchor, it’s possible to build with it. For example: [Everclear’s Solana spoke](https://github.com/everclearorg/monorepo/tree/dev/packages/contracts/solana-spoke/programs/everclear_spoke/src) - uses Anchor with Hyperlane’s SVM mailbox.

**What testing frameworks can I use for Solana programs?**

- Hyperlane uses the `solana-program-test` crate for unit and integration testing. This is a native Rust tool. If you're using Anchor, you might find Anchor's built-in testing utilities or general Rust test frameworks helpful.

## Cairo

The Hyperlane protocol has been implemented in Cairo for Starkware by the [Pragma team](https://www.pragma.build/).

You can find the in progress [implementation here](https://github.com/astraly-labs/hyperlane_starknet).

## Move

Hyperlane has been implemented in MoveVM by [Movement Labs](https://movementlabs.xyz/).

You can find the in progress [implementation here](https://github.com/movementlabsxyz/hyperlane-monorepo). These Move contracts are live on Movement's M1 testnet.

## Sway

Find our in progress [Sway implementation here](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/fuel-contracts).
