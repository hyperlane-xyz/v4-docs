title: "Deploy a Cosmos HWR"
---

## Outcomes

You will be deploying a Hyperlane Warp Route (HWR) for an asset of your choice between Cosmos SDK chains, or between a Cosmos chain and an EVM/SVM chain, provided there is an existing Hyperlane core deployment.

<Info>
  **Looking for cross-VM guides?**
  This guide focuses on Cosmos-native deployments. For cross-chain setups, see:
  - [EVM ↔ Cosmos Warp Route Guide](/docs/guides/warp-routes/evm-cosmos-warp-route-guide)
  - [SVM ↔ Cosmos Warp Route Guide](/docs/guides/warp-routes/svm-cosmos-warp-route-guide)
</Info>

## HWR Types

The type of token used determines the HWR type. In Cosmos, tokens are identified by their **denominations (denoms)** rather than contract addresses.

- [Collateral](/docs/protocol/warp-routes/warp-routes-types#collateral-backed-erc20-warp-routes): Handles the transfer of existing tokens by locking them on the source chain. This can be a native denom (e.g., `uatom`, `uhyp`) or an IBC denom (e.g., `ibc/27394FB092D2ECCD56123C74F36E4C1F926001CEADA9CA97EA622B25F41E5EB2`).
- [Synthetic](/docs/protocol/warp-routes/warp-routes-types#synthetic-erc20-warp-routes): Handles synthetic tokens that are minted and burned as transfers occur. The Hyperlane CLI deploys a new token representation on the destination chain.

### Common Setup: Collateral to Synthetic
The most common pattern is **Collateral to Synthetic**. You lock an existing token (Collateral) on its origin chain to mint a new representation (Synthetic) on the destination chain. When transferring back, the Synthetic token is burned and the Collateral is unlocked.

## Before You Start

- **Hyperlane Core**: Ensure Hyperlane core components are deployed on your target chains. If not, follow the [Deploy Hyperlane to Cosmos](/docs/guides/chains/deploy-hyperlane-cosmos) guide.
- **Deployer Wallet**: You need a private key for a wallet funded with native tokens on all participating chains to pay for deployment and transaction fees.
- **Hyperlane CLI**: Install the [Hyperlane CLI](/docs/reference/developer-tools/cli).

## Walkthrough: Deploy a Cosmos HWR

### Step 1: Create Warp Deployment Config

Create a YAML file (e.g., `warp-route-deployment.yaml`) to define your Warp Route. This config maps chain names to their respective token settings.

```yaml
# Replace chain names, addresses, and token details with your own values.
# Each chain uses its own bech32 prefix for addresses.
hyp1:
  type: collateral
  token: uhyp
  owner: "hyp1jq304cthpx0lwhpqzrdjrcza559ukyy3sc4dw5"
  mailbox: "hyp1..."  # Your chain's Mailbox address
  name: Hyperlane Token
  symbol: HYP
  decimals: 6

hyp2:
  type: synthetic
  owner: "hyp2..."    # Owner address on the destination chain
  mailbox: "hyp2..."  # Destination chain's Mailbox address
  name: Hyperlane Token
  symbol: HYP
  decimals: 6
```

#### Config Schema
| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `type` | `collateral` (lock existing) or `synthetic` (mint new). |
| `token` | The token denomination (e.g., `uhyp`, `uatom`, or an `ibc/` path). Required for `collateral`. |
| `owner` | The Bech32 address that will own the Warp Route components. |
| `mailbox` | The address of the Mailbox. |
| `name` | The display name of the token. |
| `symbol` | The token symbol. |
| `decimals` | The number of decimal places (usually `6` for Cosmos SDK tokens). |

### Step 2: Deploy the Warp Route

Run the deployment command using the Hyperlane CLI. The CLI will prompt you for the private key for each chain if it's not provided via environment variables.

```bash
hyperlane warp deploy --config ./warp-route-deployment.yaml
```

<Note>
  You can also set your private key as an environment variable to skip prompts:
  `export HYP_KEY_COSMOSNATIVE=<your_hex_private_key>`

  For mixed EVM ↔ Cosmos routes, also set `HYP_KEY` for the EVM side.
</Note>

Upon success, the CLI will output the deployment artifacts to `~/.hyperlane/deployments/warp_routes/`.

### Step 3: Verify the Deployment

You can verify the state of your deployed Warp Route by reading its configuration from the chains.

```bash
hyperlane warp read --warpRouteId HYP/hyp1
```

Replace `HYP/hyp1` with your actual Warp Route ID (usually `SYMBOL/label`).

### Step 4: Test a Transfer

<Note>
  `hyperlane warp send` does not currently support Cosmos SDK chains. To test your warp route, run a [relayer](/docs/operate/relayer/run-relayer) between your chains and initiate a transfer using the chain's native transaction tooling to interact with the warp route module.
</Note>

You can verify the warp route is correctly registered on both chains by reading each side:

```bash
hyperlane warp read --warpRouteId HYP/hyp1
hyperlane warp read --warpRouteId HYP/hyp2
```
