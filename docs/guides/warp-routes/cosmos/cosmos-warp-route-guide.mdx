title: "Deploy a Cosmos HWR"
---

## Outcomes

You will be deploying a Hyperlane Warp Route (HWR) for an asset of your choice between Cosmos SDK chains, or between a Cosmos chain and an EVM/SVM chain, provided there is an existing Hyperlane core deployment.

<Info>
  **Looking for EVM ↔ Cosmos?**
  This guide focuses on Cosmos-native deployments. For cross-chain setups involving EVM, check out the [EVM ↔ Cosmos Warp Route Guide](/docs/guides/warp-routes/evm-cosmos-warp-route-guide).

## HWR Types

The type of token used determines the HWR type. In Cosmos, tokens are identified by their **denominations (denoms)** rather than contract addresses.

- [Collateral](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/protocol/warp-routes/warp-routes-types#collateral-backed-erc20-warp-routes): Handles the transfer of existing tokens by locking them on the source chain. This can be a native denom (e.g., `uatom`, `uhyp`) or an IBC denom (e.g., `ibc/27394FB092D2ECCD56123C74F36E4C1F926001CEADA9CA97EA622B25F41E5EB2`).
- [Synthetic](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/protocol/warp-routes/warp-routes-types#synthetic-erc20-warp-routes): Handles synthetic tokens that are minted and burned as transfers occur. The Hyperlane CLI deploys a new token representation on the destination chain.

### Common Setup: Collateral to Synthetic
The most common pattern is **Collateral to Synthetic**. You lock an existing token (Collateral) on its origin chain to mint a new representation (Synthetic) on the destination chain. When transferring back, the Synthetic token is burned and the Collateral is unlocked.

## Before You Start

- **Hyperlane Core**: Ensure Hyperlane core contracts are deployed on your target chains. If not, follow the [Deploy Hyperlane to Cosmos](/docs/guides/chains/deploy-hyperlane-cosmos) guide.
- **Deployer Wallet**: You need a private key for a wallet funded with native tokens on all participating chains to pay for deployment and transaction fees.
- **Hyperlane CLI**: Install the [Hyperlane CLI](/docs/reference/developer-tools/cli).

## Walkthrough: Deploy a Cosmos HWR

### Step 1: Create Warp Deployment Config

Create a YAML file (e.g., `warp-route-deployment.yaml`) to define your Warp Route. This config maps chain names to their respective token settings.

```yaml
hyp1:
  type: collateral
  token: uhyp
  owner: "hyp1jq304cthpx0lwhpqzrdjrcza559ukyy3sc4dw5"
  mailbox: "hyp1mailboxaddress..."
  name: Hyperlane Token
  symbol: HYP
  decimals: 6

hyp2:
  type: synthetic
  owner: "hyp2jq304cthpx0lwhpqzrdjrcza559ukyy3sc4dw5"
  mailbox: "hyp2mailboxaddress..."
  name: Hyperlane Token
  symbol: HYP
  decimals: 6
```

#### Config Schema
| Field | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `type` | `collateral` (lock existing) or `synthetic` (mint new). |
| `token` | The token denomination (e.g., `uhyp`, `uatom`, or an `ibc/` path). Required for `collateral`. |
| `owner` | The Bech32 address that will own the Warp Route contracts. |
| `mailbox` | The address of the Mailbox contract. |
| `name` | The display name of the token. |
| `symbol` | The token symbol. |
| `decimals` | The number of decimal places (usually `6` for Cosmos SDK tokens). |

### Step 2: Deploy the Warp Route

Run the deployment command using the Hyperlane CLI. The CLI will prompt you for the private key for each chain if it's not provided via environment variables.

```bash
hyperlane warp deploy --config ./warp-route-deployment.yaml
```

<Note>
  You can also set your private key as an environment variable to skip prompts:
  `export HYP_KEY=<your_hex_private_key>`
</Note>

Upon success, the CLI will output the deployment artifacts to `~/.hyperlane/deployments/warp_routes/`.

### Step 3: Verify the Deployment

You can verify the state of your deployed Warp Route by reading its configuration from the chains.

```bash
hyperlane warp read --warp HYP/hyp1
```

Replace `HYP/hyp1` with your actual Warp Route ID (usually `SYMBOL/label`).

### Step 4: Test a Transfer

To ensure everything is working correctly, send a test transfer between your chains.

```bash
hyperlane warp send --origin hyp1 --destination hyp2 --warp HYP/hyp1 --relay
```

- `--origin`: The source chain name.
- `--destination`: The destination chain name.
- `--warp`: The Warp Route ID.
- `--relay`: Automatically relays the message to the destination chain (useful for testing).
