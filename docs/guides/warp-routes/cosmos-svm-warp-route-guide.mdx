title: "Deploy a Cosmos ↔ SVM HWR"
---

This guide walks you through deploying a Hyperlane Warp Route (HWR) between a Cosmos SDK chain and an SVM chain (Solana, Eclipse). It combines the Hyperlane TypeScript CLI for the Cosmos side with the Sealevel Rust CLI for the SVM side, linked via the `foreignDeployment` field.

## Prerequisites

- [Hyperlane CLI](/docs/reference/developer-tools/cli) (TypeScript CLI for Cosmos deployment)
- Rust (latest stable version) and [Solana CLI tools](https://docs.solanalabs.com/cli/install) (`1.18.18` for deployment)
- A funded wallet on the SVM chain (Solana keypair)
- A funded wallet on the Cosmos chain (hex private key)
- Hyperlane core deployed on both chains:
  - For SVM, see [Deploy an SVM HWR](/docs/guides/warp-routes/svm/svm-warp-route-guide) prerequisites
  - For Cosmos, see [Deploy to a Cosmos Chain](/docs/guides/chains/deploy-hyperlane-cosmos)

## Overview

Since the SVM and Cosmos chains use different deployment tooling, the workflow is:

1. **Deploy the Cosmos side** using the Hyperlane TypeScript CLI (`hyperlane warp deploy`)
2. **Deploy the SVM side** using the Sealevel Rust CLI, referencing the Cosmos deployment via `foreignDeployment`
3. **Update the Cosmos side** using `hyperlane warp apply` so the Cosmos router enrolls the SVM router

## Walkthrough

### Step 1: Deploy on the Cosmos Side

Create a warp route config for the Cosmos chain. Since we're deploying the Cosmos side first, we only need the Cosmos chain entry.

```yaml
# cosmos-warp-config.yaml
yourcosmoschain:
  type: collateral
  token: uatom  # Native denom on the Cosmos chain
  owner: "cosmos1..."  # Bech32 owner address
  mailbox: "cosmos1..."  # Bech32 Mailbox address from core deployment
  name: "Cosmos Hub"
  symbol: "ATOM"
  decimals: 6
```

Set your Cosmos private key and deploy:

```bash
export HYP_KEY_COSMOSNATIVE='<your_cosmos_hex_private_key>'
hyperlane warp deploy --config cosmos-warp-config.yaml
```

The CLI will output deployment artifacts to `~/.hyperlane/deployments/warp_routes/`. Note the Warp Route ID (usually `SYMBOL/label`, e.g. `ATOM/yourcosmoschain`) and the deployed Warp Route address — you'll need both for later steps.

```bash
# Verify the deployment (replace with your actual Warp Route ID)
hyperlane warp read --warpRouteId ATOM/yourcosmoschain
```

### Step 2: Deploy on the SVM Side

Follow the [SVM HWR guide](/docs/guides/warp-routes/svm/svm-warp-route-guide) for building programs and preparing your environment.

Create a `token-config.json` for the SVM side, referencing the Cosmos deployment via `foreignDeployment`:

```json
{
  "solanamainnet": {
    "type": "synthetic",
    "decimals": 6,
    "name": "Cosmos Hub",
    "symbol": "ATOM",
    "uri": "<permalink to token metadata JSON>",
    "interchainGasPaymaster": "<overhead IGP from core program-ids.json>"
  },
  "yourcosmoschain": {
    "type": "collateral",
    "decimals": 6,
    "token": "uatom",
    "foreignDeployment": "<cosmos_warp_route_bech32_address>"
  }
}
```

The `interchainGasPaymaster` value is the overhead IGP address from your SVM chain's [core deployment artifacts](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/tree/main/rust/sealevel/environments/mainnet3) at `<chain>/core/program-ids.json`.

Deploy from the Sealevel client directory:

```bash
# From rust/sealevel/client
cargo run -- -k ./warp-route-deployer-key.json warp-route deploy \
  --warp-route-name atom \
  --environment mainnet3 \
  --environments-dir ../environments \
  --built-so-dir ../target/deploy \
  --token-config-file ../environments/mainnet3/warp-routes/atom/token-config.json \
  --registry ~/path/to/your/local/hyperlane-registry \
  --ata-payer-funding-amount 50000000
```

The SVM deployment writes program IDs under `rust/sealevel/environments/mainnet3/warp-routes/atom/program-ids.json`. You will need the SVM warp route program ID for the next step.

### Step 3: Update Cosmos-Side Router Enrollment

Create an apply config that includes the SVM chain as a `foreignDeployment`:

```yaml
# cosmos-warp-apply.yaml
yourcosmoschain:
  type: collateral
  token: uatom
  owner: "cosmos1..."
  mailbox: "cosmos1..."
  name: "Cosmos Hub"
  symbol: "ATOM"
  decimals: 6

solanamainnet:
  type: synthetic
  owner: "<svm_owner_base58_address>"
  foreignDeployment: "<svm_warp_route_program_id_base58>"
```

Then apply — the CLI resolves the existing warp core config from the registry using the route ID:

```bash
hyperlane warp apply \
  --warpRouteId ATOM/yourcosmoschain \
  --config ./cosmos-warp-apply.yaml
```

### Step 4: Verify Both Sides

**SVM side:**

```bash
# From rust/sealevel/client
cargo run -- -k ./warp-route-deployer-key.json \
  -u <SOLANA_RPC_URL> token query \
  --program-id <PROGRAM_ID> synthetic
```

**Cosmos side:**

```bash
hyperlane warp read --warpRouteId ATOM/yourcosmoschain
```

### Step 5: Test a Transfer

<Note>
  `hyperlane warp send` does not currently support Cosmos SDK or SVM chains. To test your cross-chain warp route, run a [relayer](/docs/operate/relayer/run-relayer) between your chains and initiate a transfer from the SVM side using the Sealevel CLI, or from the Cosmos side using native transaction tooling.
</Note>

To transfer from SVM to Cosmos:

```bash
# From rust/sealevel/client
cargo run -- -u <SOLANA_RPC_URL> \
  -k ./warp-route-deployer-key.json \
  token transfer-remote ./warp-route-deployer-key.json \
  <AMOUNT> <COSMOS_DOMAIN_ID> <RECIPIENT_HEX_ADDRESS> \
  synthetic --program-id <PROGRAM_ID>
```

<Note>
  The recipient address must be in hex format (not bech32). You can convert a bech32 address to hex using any bech32 decoder — the hex part is the data portion after removing the human-readable prefix. The relayer handles the conversion back to bech32 on the destination chain.
</Note>

## Important Considerations

### Decimals

Cosmos tokens typically use 6 decimals, which is compatible with SVM's standard precision. If bridging a token with different decimals on each side, use the `remoteDecimals` field in the SVM config (see the [EVM ↔ SVM guide](/docs/guides/warp-routes/evm-svm-warp-route-guide) for an example).

### Address Formats

- **SVM**: Base58-encoded public keys (e.g., `D6k6T3G74ij6atCtBiWBs5TbFa1hFVcrFUSGZHuV7q3Z`)
- **Cosmos**: Bech32 addresses (e.g., `cosmos1...`)

The `foreignDeployment` field in the SVM `token-config.json` accepts the Cosmos bech32 address directly.

### Router Enrollment

This route is fully bidirectional only after both sides enroll each other:

- The SVM deploy step enrolls the Cosmos router on the SVM side.
- The `warp apply` step enrolls the SVM router on the Cosmos side.

### Key Management

- **SVM side**: Uses a Solana keypair file (JSON format)
- **Cosmos side**: Uses a hex private key via `HYP_KEY_COSMOSNATIVE` or `--key.cosmosnative`

For production deployments, transfer ownership to a multisig setup — [Squads](https://squads.so/) for SVM or a Cosmos-native multisig for the Cosmos side.
