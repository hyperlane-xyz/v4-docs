title: "Deploy Multi-Collateral Warp Routes"
---

This guide walks you through how to use Hyperlane Warp Routes to create multi-collateral token bridges, allowing assets to be sourced from multiple chains instead of a single origin.

<Info>
  - For a primer on Multi-collateral warp routes head over to: [Multi-collateral
  Warp Routes](/docs/applications/warp-routes/multi-collateral-warp-routes)
</Info>

## Prerequisites

To complete this walkthrough, you should have the following:

1. Two collateral chains and one synthetic chain of your choice, between which you’d like to deploy the multi-collateral warp route. Make sure to have some funds on the chains to cover deployment gas fees.
2. The token(s) to be used as collateral.
3. An installed instance of the [Hyperlane CLI](https://docs.hyperlane.xyz/docs/reference/developer-tools/cli) and a wallet private key set as the `HYP_KEY` env var funded on your origin and destination networks.

## Deploy your Multi-Collateral Warp Routes

### 1. Create your Warp Route Config

1. Use the Hyperlane CLI to initialize a Warp Route deployment file:

`hyperlane warp init`

This command provides a walkthrough, prompting you for configuration choices directly in the terminal.

Here's how your setup should look like:

- Select three networks: choose `collateral` for the two source networks, and `synthetic` for the destination network.
- Input the token address, proxy admin contracts and select if you'd like to use a trusted ISMs.

Once you've made the selection, the CLI will generate a Warp Route config file at `./configs/warp-route-deployment.yaml`.

### 2. Deploy your Warp Route

Once your configuration is ready, you can initiate the Warp Route deployment with:

`hyperlane warp deploy`

During deployment, the CLI requires access to your private key to sign transactions. You can enter it when prompted or set your private key as `HYP_KEY`. Make sure that your wallet has sufficient funds on all relevant chains to cover the gas costs for the deployment.

### 3. Testing

You can initiate a test transfer with the following command:

`hyperlane warp send --symbol TOKEN`

The CLI will prompt you to:

- Select a matching Warp Route
- Choose the origin and destination chains

<Info>
  When sending between two `collateral` chains, make sure there’s sufficient
  collateral available on the destination chain to complete the transfer.
  Synthetic tokens are minted on the destination. In collateral routes, tokens
  must already exist on the destination chain in order to be released.
</Info>

It’ll run checks and send the message. You’ll get:

- A transaction link (e.g., BaseScan)
- A message ID and explorer link
- Confirmation once processed

<Success>
  🎉 **Congrats!** You have successfully deployed a Multi-Collateral Warp Route.
  Your users can now bridge assets from multiple chains!
</Success>
