title: "Deploy an EVM ↔ Cosmos HWR"
---

This guide walks you through deploying a Hyperlane Warp Route (HWR) between an EVM-based chain and a Cosmos SDK chain using the Hyperlane CLI.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- [Hyperlane CLI](/docs/reference/developer-tools/cli) installed.
- Funded wallets on both the EVM and Cosmos chains.
- Hyperlane core contracts (Mailbox, etc.) already deployed on both chains.
  - For Cosmos, see [Deploy to a Cosmos Chain](/docs/guides/chains/deploy-hyperlane-cosmos).
  - For EVM, see [Deploy Hyperlane](/docs/guides/chains/deploy-hyperlane).

## Walkthrough

### Step 1: Create the Warp Route Config

Create a YAML file (e.g., `warp-route-config.yaml`) that defines the token and connection details for both chains.

```yaml
ethereum:
  type: collateral
  token: "0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48"  # USDC on Ethereum
  mailbox: "0xc005dc82818d67AF737725bD4bf75435d065D239"
  owner: "0xa7ECcdb9Be08178f896c26b7BbD8C3D4E844d9Ba"
  interchainSecurityModule: "0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000" # Zero address = use the default ISM configured in the destination Mailbox
  gas: 300000 # Set a ceiling for expected Cosmos-side compute units

yourcosmoschain:
  type: synthetic
  mailbox: "hyp1mailboxaddress..." # Bech32 address
  owner: "hyp1owneraddress..."     # Bech32 address
  name: "USD Coin"
  symbol: "USDC"
  decimals: 6
  # foreignDeployment: "hyp1..."   # Use if the Cosmos HWR is already deployed
```

#### Key Fields

- **`type`**: Use `collateral` for the chain where the original token exists, and `synthetic` for the chain where the new token will be minted.
- **`token`**: On EVM, this is the ERC20 contract address. On Cosmos, if using `collateral`, this would be the native denom (e.g., `uatom`).
- **`foreignDeployment`**: This field is used to link to an existing Warp Route contract on the remote chain. If you have already deployed the Cosmos side, provide its address here to enroll it in the EVM deployment.
- **`interchainSecurityModule`**: Set to `0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000` to use the default ISM configured in the destination Mailbox.
- **`gas`**: In the EVM config, `gas` sets the Cosmos-side compute unit ceiling for message delivery. Start conservative and increase if messages run out of gas.

### Step 2: Deploy the Warp Route

Run the deployment command using the Hyperlane CLI:

```bash
hyperlane warp deploy --config warp-route-config.yaml
```

The CLI will prompt you for the private keys for each chain.

<Note>
**Private Key Format:** Both EVM and Cosmos keys should be provided in **hex format** (64 characters, with or without `0x` prefix). The CLI handles the derivation of the bech32 address for Cosmos automatically.
</Note>

### Step 3: Verify the Deployment

After the deployment completes, you can verify the state of your Warp Route on both sides:

```bash
hyperlane warp read --warpRouteId USDC/ethereum
```

This will output the current configuration and contract addresses for the route.

### Step 4: Test a Transfer

<Note>
  `hyperlane warp send` does not currently support Cosmos SDK chains. To test your cross-chain warp route, run a [relayer](/docs/guides/deploy-agents/run-relayer) between your chains and initiate a transfer from the EVM side using the deployed HypERC20 contract, or from the Cosmos side using native transaction tooling.
</Note>

Verify the warp route is correctly registered on both sides:

```bash
hyperlane warp read --warpRouteId USDC/ethereum
```

## Important Considerations

### Address Formats
EVM chains use hex addresses (starting with `0x`), while Cosmos chains use bech32 addresses (e.g., `cosmos1...`). The Hyperlane CLI handles the conversion between these formats automatically when interacting with the different protocols.

### Gas and Fees
When sending a message from EVM to Cosmos, you must specify a sufficient `gas` limit in your config. This represents the compute units on the Cosmos side. Set this as a ceiling based on expected execution and raise it if delivery fails due to out-of-gas. Ensure your EVM wallet has enough native tokens to pay for the interchain gas fees.
