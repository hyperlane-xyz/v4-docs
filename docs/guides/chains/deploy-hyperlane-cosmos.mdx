title: "Deploy to a Cosmos Chain"
description: "Step-by-step guide on how to connect your Cosmos SDK chain with Hyperlane"
---

<Note>

- This guide is for **Cosmos SDK** chains with the Hyperlane module integrated. For CosmWasm-based chains, see the [CosmWasm implementation](https://github.com/many-things/cw-hyperlane).
- It will walk you through deploying Hyperlane to your new chain as quickly as possible for testing, not production. This includes the core Mailbox and ISM contracts as well as Hyperlane Warp Route contracts for asset bridging.
- To see which chains are already supported, visit the [Registry](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-registry/tree/main/chains).
- If you need any help, reach out on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-monorepo/discussions) or [get in touch](https://forms.gle/KyRTaWvo4XNmNvrq6).

</Note>

## Prerequisites

Anyone can begin this quickstart guide once they have the following artifacts & assets available:

- A new, custom, or pre-existing Cosmos SDK network of your choice, including the following metadata:
  - A chain name, e.g. `hyp1`
  - A chain ID, e.g. `hyperlane-local-1`
  - A bech32 prefix, e.g. `hyp`
  - RPC, REST, and gRPC URLs
  - Native token denomination and gas price
- A deployer wallet hex private key (64 hex chars, no `0x` prefix)
  - This wallet should be funded on your custom chain and any chain you will be passing messages to & from
- [Hyperlane CLI](/docs/reference/developer-tools/cli)

## 1. Registry

Let’s create a custom chain config, run:

```bash
hyperlane registry init
```

Follow the prompts to set up your chain metadata. Ensure you select `cosmosnative` as the protocol.

Now, under `$HOME/.hyperlane/chains` you will find a new folder named with your custom chain’s name, and a file named `metadata.yaml` within that folder.

<details> 
  <summary>
    Example content of this config at `$HOME/.hyperlane/chains/yourchain/metadata.yaml`
  </summary>

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=../schema.json
# Metadata for your custom Cosmos chain

bech32Prefix: hyp
chainId: hyperlane-local-1
displayName: My Cosmos Chain
domainId: 758986691
name: yourchain
protocol: cosmosnative

restUrls:
  - http: http://127.0.0.1:1317
grpcUrls:
  - http: http://127.0.0.1:9090
blockExplorers:
  - name: My Chain Explorer
    url: https://mychain.com/explorer
```

</details>

## 2. Core

Next, let’s configure, deploy and test your custom chain’s core contracts.

### Initialize configuration

1. From your local environment, set the hex private key of your funded deployer address to `HYP_KEY`. For example: `export HYP_KEY='<YOUR_PRIVATE_KEY>'` (64 hex characters, with or without `0x` prefix)
2. From the same terminal instance, run:

```bash
hyperlane core init
```

<details>
  <summary>
    The deployment config will be written to `./configs/core-config.yaml`
  </summary>

```yaml
# The address that owns and manages the deployed contracts. This account has admin privileges.
owner: "hyp1jq304cthpx0lwhpqzrdjrcza559ukyy3sc4dw5"

# The default Interchain Security Module (ISM) configuration.
defaultIsm:
  # Specifies the type of ISM. Here, it uses a multisig ISM.
  type: merkleRootMultisigIsm
  threshold: 1
  validators:
    # Validators use hex addresses (0x...) even on Cosmos chains.
    - '0x0c60e7eCd06429052223C78452F791AAb5C5CAc6'

defaultHook:
  # A hook configuration that specifies the use of an Interchain Gas Paymaster.
  type: interchainGasPaymaster
  owner: "hyp1jq304cthpx0lwhpqzrdjrcza559ukyy3sc4dw5"
  beneficiary: "hyp1jq304cthpx0lwhpqzrdjrcza559ukyy3sc4dw5"
  oracleKey: "hyp1jq304cthpx0lwhpqzrdjrcza559ukyy3sc4dw5"
  overhead:
    hyp: 200000
  oracleConfig:
    hyp:
      gasPrice: '1'
      tokenDecimals: 6
      tokenExchangeRate: '10000000000'

requiredHook:
  # The type of hook. This one applies a Merkle Tree for message dispatch.
  type: merkleTreeHook
```

</details>

### Deploy contracts

To deploy contracts, run:

```bash
hyperlane core deploy
```

Use the arrows and enter to select your custom chain from the bottom of the list. It will take a few minutes for all contracts to deploy.

<details>
  <summary>
    Under `$HOME/.hyperlane/chains` you will find a new folder named with your
    custom chain’s name, and a file named `addresses.yaml` within that folder
  </summary>

```yaml
# Example — your actual bech32 addresses will differ
mailbox: "hyp1mailboxaddress..."
interchainAccountRouter: "hyp1icarouteraddress..."
interchainAccountIsm: "hyp1icaismaddress..."
validatorAnnounce: "hyp1validatorannounceaddress..."
testRecipient: "hyp1testrecipientaddress..."
```

</details>

<Note>
  [Aggregation ISMs](/docs/protocol/ISM/standard-ISMs/aggregation-ISM) are currently not supported on Cosmos SDK chains due to AltVM limitations. Use `messageIdMultisigIsm` or `merkleRootMultisigIsm` instead.
</Note>

### Send test message

To send a test message, run:

```bash
hyperlane send message --relay
```

The `--relay` flag is optional and will deliver the message to the destination chain. The `send message` command is protocol-agnostic and works seamlessly with Cosmos SDK chains.

You can also run a relayer in the background with

```bash
hyperlane relayer --chains yourchain,sepolia
```

  **🎉 Congrats! You have successfully sent a message to your custom Cosmos chain**

## 3. Hyperlane Warp Route

Now that you have a Hyperlane Mailbox and core contracts on your chain, it’s time to set up token bridging between your chain and any other Hyperlane chain.

Continue on to the [Deploy a Cosmos Warp Route](/docs/guides/warp-routes/cosmos/cosmos-warp-route-guide) docs for more details.

## 4. Submit to Registry

If you want other chains to connect with you as well as to take this to production, make a registry PR.

### Ensure complete info

Make sure your metadata is complete:

- add a `logo.svg` file inside the folder
- include `Deployer` information identifying the team deploying
- indicate `isTestnet` `true` if the chain is testnet
- lint the yaml files and order alphabetically

### Commit to GitHub

First, navigate to your local instance of the registry and commit changes

```bash
cd ~/.hyperlane && git init && git add . && git commit
```

Then, sync local registry with canonical registry

```bash
git remote add canonical git@github.com:hyperlane-xyz/hyperlane-registry.git
git pull canonical main --rebase
```

Finally, push local registry to github fork and submit a PR. Please include a [changeset](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/adding-a-changeset.md) in your PR.
