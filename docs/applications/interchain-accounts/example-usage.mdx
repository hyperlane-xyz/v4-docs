### Encoding

When calling remote contracts using `callRemote`, the function parameters must be encoded into an array of `Call` structs.

Each `Call` struct contains:

- `to`: The target contract address (converted to bytes32).
- `value`: The ETH or native token amount to send with the call.
- `data`: The function call data, which can be encoded using abi.encodeCall.

`Call.data` can be easily encoded with the `abi.encodeCall` function.

```solidity
struct Call {
    bytes32 to; // supporting non EVM targets
    uint256 value;
    bytes data;
}

interface IUniswapV3Pool {
    function swap(
        address recipient,
        bool zeroForOne,
        int256 amountSpecified,
        uint160 sqrtPriceLimitX96,
        bytes calldata data
    ) external returns (int256 amount0, int256 amount1);
}

IUniswapV3Pool pool = IUniswapV3Pool(...);
Call swapCall = Call({
    to: TypeCasts.addressToBytes32(address(pool)),
    data: abi.encodeCall(pool.swap, (...));
    value: 0,
});
uint32 ethereumDomain = 1;
IInterchainAccountRouter(0xabc...).callRemote(ethereumDomain, [swapCall]);
```

### Typescript Usage

We also have Typescript tooling to easily deploy ICA accounts and call `callRemote` on the origin chain:

```typescript
const localChain = 'ethereum';
const signer = <YOUR_SIGNER>;
const localRouter: InterchainAccountRouter = InterchainAccountRouter__factory.connect(<ICA_ROUTER_ADDRESS>, signer);
const recipientAddress = <EXAMPLE_ADDRESS>; // use your own address here
const recipientF = new TestRecipient__factory.connect(recipientAddress, signer); // use your own contract here
const fooMessage = "Test";
const data = recipient.interface.encodeFunctionData("fooBar", [1, fooMessage]);

const call = {
  to: recipientAddress,
  data,
  value: BigNumber.from("0"),
};
const quote = await local["quoteGasPayment(uint32)"](
  multiProvider.getDomainId(remoteChain)
);

const config: AccountConfig = {
  origin: localChain,
  owner: signer.address,
  localRouter: localRouter.address,
};
await localRouter.callRemote(localChain, remoteChain, [call], config);
```

### Determine addresses

In some cases, you may need to compute the ICA address on a remote chain before making a call. For example, if your ICA needs funding before executing transactions, you can retrieve its address and transfer assets to it in advance. See the [Transfer and Call Pattern](/docs/guides/transfer-and-call) section for more information.

The `getRemoteInterchainAccount` function can be used to get the address of an ICA given the destination chain and owner address.

An example is included below of a contract precomputing its own Interchain Account address.

```solidity
address myInterchainAccount = IInterchainAccountRouter(...).getRemoteInterchainAccount(
    destination,
    address(this)
);
```

If you are using [#overrides](#overrides) to specify remote chains, pass those overrides when computing the remote ICA address.

```solidity
address myRemoteIca = IInterchainAccountRouter(...).getRemoteInterchainAccount(
    address(this),
    remoteRouterOverride,
    remoteIsmOverride
);
```

## Overrides

Interchain Accounts allow developers to override the default chains and security models configured in the `InterchainAccountRouter`.

These are useful for:

- Calling an ICA on chains not configured in `InterchainAccountRouter`.
- Using different ISM than the defaults configured in the `InterchainAccountRouter`
- Adjusting the gas limit for IGP payments or setting other parameters.

### Interface

The `callRemoteWithOverrides` function looks similar to the `callRemote` function, but takes three additional arguments.

First, developers can override `_router`, the address of the `InterchainAccountRouter` on the remote chain. This allows developers to control an ICA on remote chains that have not been configured on the local `InterchainAccountRouter`.

Second, developers can override `_ism`, the address of the remote interchain security module (ISM) used to secure their ICA. This ISM will be used to verify the interchain messages passed between the local and remote `InterchainAccountRouters`. This allows developers to use a custom security model that best suits their needs.

Third, developers can override `_hookMetadata`, the [StandardHookMetadata](../libraries/hookmetadata) metadata passed to the message hooks for each ICA call (for example, overriding the gas limit for the IGP payment).

```solidity
    /**
     * @notice Dispatches a sequence of remote calls to be made by an owner's
     * interchain account on the destination domain
     * @dev Recommend using CallLib.build to format the interchain calls
     * @param _destination The remote domain of the chain to make calls on
     * @param _router The remote router address
     * @param _ism The remote ISM address
     * @param _calls The sequence of calls to make
     * @param _hookMetadata The hook metadata to override with for the hook set by the owner
     * @return The Hyperlane message ID
     */
    function callRemoteWithOverrides(
        uint32 _destination,
        bytes32 _router,
        bytes32 _ism,
        CallLib.Call[] calldata _calls,
        bytes memory _hookMetadata
    ) public payable returns (bytes32)

    function getRemoteInterchainAccount(
        address _owner,
        address _router,
        address _ism
    ) public view returns (address)
```
