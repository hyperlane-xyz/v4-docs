title: "HWR Interface"
---

Hyperlane Warp Routes (HWR) leverage the `IHypERC20` token interface. HWR tokens implement this interface, which extends the standard `ERC20` interface.

```solidity
/// @notice An interchain extension of the ERC20 interface
interface IHypERC20 is IERC20 {
    /**
     * @notice Transfers tokens to the specified recipient on a remote chain
     * @param _destination The domain ID of the destination chain
     * @param _recipient The address of the recipient, encoded as bytes32
     * @param _amount The amount of tokens to transfer
     */
    function transferRemote(
        uint32 _destination,
        bytes32 _recipient,
        uint256 _amount
    ) external payable;
}
```
