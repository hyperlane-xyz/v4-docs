## Fee Estimation

When sending a cross-chain message with Hyperlane GMP, two fees are paid:

1. **Origin Fee** – transaction fee on the origin chain (charged by the blockchain)
2. [**Interchain Fee**](/docs/protocol/core/interchain-gas-payment) – charged to cover destination chain transaction fees

This fee structure ensures that:

1. The user has enough funds to pay for the origin transaction
2. The cross-chain message will have enough gas to execute on the destination chain and pay for the message delivery
3. The total cost of the transfer is transparent to the user before execution

#### Fee Token Considerations

When sending cross-chain messages, the fee tokens vary by origin chain type and IGP:

1. **EVM Chains**

   - Uses native gas token (e.g., ETH) for both origin and interchain fees

2. **Sealevel (Solana) Chains**

   - Uses native gas token (e.g., SOL) for both origin and interchain fees

3. **Cosmos Chains**

   - Supports custom tokens; fees are specified using the `denom` parameter on an IGP
   - Fees are specified using the `denom` parameter
